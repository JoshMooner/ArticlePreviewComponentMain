## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Event Listener "onclick" on JS

### What I learned

This is my first project with JavaScript, I learned a way to manage the "onclick" event with a function. Also, I learned to use the querySelectors and the manipulation of objects and methods. By another side, I applied my skills on the mobile responsive and desktop LayOut with properties of css such as: flex-box, position relative and absolute, transitions, etc.


### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on the JS code on future projects. This is my first code on HTML+CSS+JS so I wanto to keep learning using this three languages. Also I want to learn more about the building of the responisve mobile because I think I don't manage so well.

### Useful resources

- [W3 JS Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - This helped me because it contains a lot of tutorials about the use of JS.
- [Falcon Master](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJl1YajcPWTeJNsQhGyMIMg) - This is an amazing chanel which helped to me to understand the basics aspects about LayOut on CSS and proporties on JS. I'd recommend it to anyone who want to learn the basis of the language.
